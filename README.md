In this project, the dataset Superstore contained almost 10.000 order lines from a fictional e-commerce business selling products used in offices to customer base in the US.

The project started with establishing a more efficient setup for storing the data in several tables. Two entity relationship diagrams were created. 
The second version represents the final version, which I would consider the more efficient from the two versions.  

I chose to focus on the product portfolio. This allowed my to apply elements of Product Portfolio Management and identify Product Lifecycle stages.

I could generate insights into buy-sell-ratio, profitability and discount strategy. 

The uploaded files include a presentation in which I make recommendation which steps should be undertaken to optimize / prune the product portfolio.

Towards the end of the project a Machine Learning method of Clustering was used. I tried four different models (KMeans, DBSCAN, Fuzzy Means, Hierachical Clustering). 
I used Principal Component Analysis to find the best features to us for Clustering. And then I applied Elbow-Method to identify optimal number of clusters and analyzed the clustering results with the help of Silhouette Coefficient and the Davis-Bouldin-Index.
